# Rails Portfolio

This project was an exercise in devoping a basic static site using Ruby on Rails. The extent to which this is a portfolio is only in that it includes screenshots of some other rails projects I coded while working up to this one. Is is not my actual portfolio - that can be found at https://augustinecalvino.dev/. This project uses Bootstrap classes for some simple styling. It also gave me experience deploying to the Heroku serverless platform where I am hosting this live.

## running locally

Just clone the repository, run `bundle install` from the project root, and then `rails server`.
